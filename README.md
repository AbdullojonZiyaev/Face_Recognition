# Face Detection and Recognition System

This repository contains scripts for extracting, training, and detecting faces using a combination of Python, OpenCV, Dlib, and TensorFlow.

## Overview

This project provides a complete pipeline for face detection and recognition:
1. **Face Extraction**: Extract faces from video or image files.
2. **Model Training**: Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the extracted faces.
3. **Face Detection**: Use the trained model to detect faces in new images or videos.
